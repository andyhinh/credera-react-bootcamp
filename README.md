# crederabootcamp
Final two days of Credera's Front-end bootcamp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objectives
This project will reflect both solo assignment and pair programming excercise for the last two days. You are allowed to get a headstart and complete the next objectives prior to it being assigned or add more functionalities as you like for more brownie points.

Order of Completion:
1) (Solo, July 18th) Turning the page into a multi-page single page application with a form that console logs the input on submission 
2) (Pair, July 18th) Adding complexity to the form (i.e. Login/Create Account form)
3) (Solo, July 19th) Refactor the application to allow searches for other subreddits
4) (Pair, July 19th) Implement an Reddit Subreddit API call that can persist, update, and retrieve data (Hooks/Redux)

## Additional Note(s)
The components were created in different ways to demonstrate different ways of creating components (Class/State vs Functional/Stateless). React is making stateless its preferred component creation; however, classes will be relevant for lifecycles.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
