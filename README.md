# crederabootcamp
Final two days of Credera's Front-end bootcamp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objectives
This project will reflect both solo assignment and pair programming excercise for the last two days. You are allowed to get a headstart and complete the next objectives prior to it being assigned or add more functionalities as you like for more brownie points.

Order of Completion:
1) (Solo, July 18th) Turning the page into a multi-page single page application with a form that console logs the input on submission 
2) (Pair, July 18th) Adding complexity to the form (i.e. Login/Create Account form)
3) (Solo, July 19th) Refactor the application to allow searches for other subreddits (Hooks/Redux)
4) (Pair, July 19th) Implement an Reddit Subreddit API call that can persist, update, invalidate, and retrieve data if needed 

## Additional Note(s)
The components were created in different ways to demonstrate different ways of creating components (Class/State vs Functional/Stateless). React is making stateless its preferred component creation; however, classes will be relevant for lifecycles.

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

This installs all the required dependencies needed to execute this project. You will need to run this after pulling down the repository.

### `npm start`
